# IoT Temperature Alert System (Simulated)

This project simulates a simple temperature monitoring system for IoT/embedded scenarios. It mimics reading data from a temperature sensor and triggers alerts if the value exceeds a set threshold.

## 🌡 Features

- Simulated sensor data generation
- Real-time temperature check with threshold
- Console alert output
- Modular and hardware-portable code (MicroPython-compatible style)

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- No external libraries

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🔧 Real-World Use Case

This project can be adapted to run on:
- ESP32 / ESP8266 using MicroPython
- Raspberry Pi with GPIO temperature sensor (e.g., DHT11, DS18B20)
- Arduino-based systems with serial bridge to Python host
